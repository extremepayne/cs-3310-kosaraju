# cs-3310-kosaraju

Implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm for finding strongly connected components for UVU CS 3310 Analysis of Algorithms. Designed as a solution to Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Illuminated problem 8.10.

Using the existing implementation of graphs in Rust provided by petgraph, but redoing the algorithm part (including DFS).

## Usage

Run without arguments for sanity checks. Pass a single filename to read in that file as a graph. See test data in [data](data/) for examples of the format.
